# 🎵 Genre Identifier

A machine learning project to classify music genres based on audio features. This tool analyzes audio files and predicts the genre using a trained model on spectral features like MFCCs.

---

## 🔍 Overview

This project uses audio feature extraction and machine learning (likely neural networks or classical classifiers) to identify the genre of input audio files (e.g., `.wav`, `.mp3`).

Features used:
- **MFCCs (Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients)**
- **Chroma Frequencies**
- **Spectral Contrast**
- **Tonnetz**

## 🎯 Features

- 🎶 Predict genre from any valid audio file
- 🔎 Visualize extracted features
- 🧠 Train your own model with a custom dataset
- 📊 Evaluate model performance with accuracy, confusion matrix, and plots
